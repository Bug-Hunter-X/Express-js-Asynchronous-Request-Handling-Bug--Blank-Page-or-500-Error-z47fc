This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in Express.js applications involving asynchronous request handling.  The bug manifests as an unexpected blank page or a 500 Internal Server Error without informative error messages in the console. This is often caused by asynchronous operations completing after the response stream has already ended. The solution implements proper error handling and ensures responses are sent only after asynchronous tasks are completed.
